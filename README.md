# Blue Bank Loan Analysis

I want to run an EDA on Blue Bank's current docket of loans. I'd like to compare relevant metrics such as FICO scores, DTI ratios, annual income logs, etc. 

## Description

Blue Bank is a bank in the US that has a loan department which is currently understaffed. They supply loans to individuals and don't have much reporting on how risky these borrowers are. 

Using Python and Tableau, they'd like to see a report of borrowers who may have issues paying back their loans.
